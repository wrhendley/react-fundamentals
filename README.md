# React Fundamentals

This is the repo for the Python syntax assignment.

To run this on your local machine, you will need to have Node.js installed.  In your terminal, run the following commands:
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/wrhendley/react-fundamentals.git
    cd react-fundamentals
    npm install
    npm run dev
```

This will start the server, and a link to the project should show up in your terminal.  Open that link in your browser to view the project.
